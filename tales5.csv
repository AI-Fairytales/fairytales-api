title;story
Three little pigs;"Once upon a time there were three little pigs, who left their parents to see the world.
All summer long, they roamed through the woods and over the plains, playing games and having fun. None were happier than the three little pigs, and they easily made friends with everyone. Wherever they went, they were given a warm welcome, but as summer drew to a close, they realized that all drifting back to their usual jobs, and preparing for winter. Autumn came and it began to rain. The three little pigs started to feel they needed a real home. Sadly, they knew that the fun was over now and they must set to work like the others, or they'd be left in the cold and rain, with no roof over their heads. They talked about what to do, but each decided for himself. The laziest little pig said he'd build a straw hut.
'It will only take a day,' he said. The others disagreed.
'It's too fragile,' they said but he refused to listen.
Not quite so lazy, the second little pig went in search of planks of seasoned wood.
It took him two days to nail them together.
But the third little pig did not like the wooden house.' It takes time, patience and hard work to build a house that is strong enough to stand up to wind, rain, and snow, and most of all, protect us from the wolf!'
The days passed, and the wisest little pig's house took shape, brick by brick. From time to time, his brothers visited him, saying,
'Why are you working so hard? Why don't you come and play?' But the stubborn bricklayer pig just said 'no'.
'I shall finish my house first. It must be strong. And then I'll come and play!' he said.' He who laughs last, laughs longest!'
Now, it was the wisest little pig that found the tracks of a big wolf in the neighborhood.
The little pigs rushed home in alarm. Along came the wolf, scowling fiercely at the laziest pig's straw hut.
'Come out!' ordered the wolf, his mouth watering. I want to speak to you!'
'I'd rather stay where I am!' replied the little pig in a tiny voice.
'I'll make you come out!' growled the wolf angrily, and puffing out his chest, he took a very deep breath. Then he blew with all his might, right onto the house. And all the straw the silly pig had heaped against some thin poles fell down. Excited by his own cleverness, the wolf did not notice that the little pig had slipped out from underneath the heap of straw, and was dashing towards his brother's wooden house. When he realized that the little pig was escaping, the wolf grew wild with rage.
'Come back!' he roared, trying to catch the pig as he ran into the wooden house.
'I hope this house won't fall down! Let's lean against the door so he can't break in!' said the little pig to his brother.
Outside, the wolf could hear the little pigs' words. Starving as he was, at the idea of a two course meal, he rained blows on the door.
'Open up! Open up! I only want to speak to you!'
Inside, the two brothers wept in fear and did their best to hold the door fast against the blows. Then the furious wolf braced himself a new effort: he drew in a really enormous breath, and went ... WHOOOOO! The wooden house collapsed like a pack of cards.
Luckily, the wisest little pig had been watching the scene from the window of his own brick house, and he rapidly opened the door to his fleeing brothers. Soon after, the wolf came hammering furiously on the door. This time, the wolf had grave doubts. This house had a much more solid air than the others. He blew once, he blew again and then for a third time but all in vain. For the house did not budge an inch. The three little pigs watched him and their fear began to fade. Quite exhausted by his efforts, the wolf decided to try one of his tricks. He scrambled up a nearby ladder, on to the roof to have a look at the chimney. However, the wisest little pig had seen this ploy, and he quickly said.
'Quick! Light the fire!' With his long legs thrust down the chimney, the wolf was not sure if he should slide down the black hole. It wouldn't be easy to get in, but the sound of the little pigs' voices below only made him feel hungrier.
'I'm dying of hunger! I'm going to try and get down.' And he let himself drop. But landing was rather hot, too hot! The wolf landed in the fire.
The flames licked his hairy coat and his tail became a flaring torch.
'Never again will I go down a chimney' he squealed, as he tried to put out the flames in his tail. Then he ran away as fast as he could.
Then the three happy little pigs, dancing round and round the yard, began to sing. 'Tra-la-la! Tra-la-la! The wicked black wolf will never come back...!'
From that terrible day on, the wisest little pig's brothers set to work with a will. In less than no time, up went the two new brick houses. The wolf did return once to roam in the neighborhood, but when he caught sight of three chimneys, he remembered the terrible pain of a burnt tail, and he left for good.
Now safe and happy, the wisest little pig called to his brothers. 'No more work! Come on, let's go and play!'"
Princess Rose on the steps with a rose in her hand;"Many, many years ago, in a kingdom far, far away there lived a beautiful
princess. She had long red hair and loved roses so much that everyone called her Princess Rose.
 Every evening after dusk, Princess Rose went out on the balcony and clapped her hands. A golden bird came flying out of nowhere and alighted
on her shoulder. Instantly, the princess's hair began to shine, ablaze with brilliant red light. When the bird started to warble an enchanting
tune, Princess Rose joined it in a song, and everyone in the kingdom fell asleep and had sweet dreams till the break of dawn.
Thus passed the years.
Every evening Princess Rose, along with the little golden bird, sang a loving lullaby, so that all people fell asleep and had sweet dreams till
the break of dawn.
Until one day something terrible happened. A wicked witch learned about Princess Rose and decided to curse her.
'Abracadabra, Sim-Sala-Bim, may the rose's color dim!' the witch said, and Princess Rose's hair instantly turned as black as tar.
That evening, too, Princess Rose went out on her balcony and clapped her hands. But when the golden bird appeared, her hair glowed black instead
of red. The bird warbled its enchanting melody, and Princess Rose sang her lullaby. Everyone in the kingdom fell asleep, but that night they
only had bad dreams and nightmares.
On the following day, the saddened princess asked the bird,
'Tell me, golden bird, how can I make my people's dreams so sweet again
till the break of dawn?'
'Black hair in rose water,' the bird chirped in reply.
The princess wondered at this counsel, but abided by it, nevertheless.
She filled up a basin with water and sprinkled rose petals on its
surface. Then, she dipped her hair into the rose water, and it instantly
turned red again.
That evening, when the bird perched on her shoulder, the radiant red
glow of her hair lit up the night sky once more. The princess sang her
lullaby, and everyone in the kingdom fell asleep and had sweet dreams
till the break of dawn.
The wicked witch was so very angry that her curse had been broken that
she decided to cast it again.
'Abracadabra, Sim-Sala-Bim, may the rose's color dim!'And the princess's
hair turned as black as tar again. Only this time the witch also picked
up all of the rose blooms in the entire kingdom.
'Let's see how you'll break my curse now!' she sneered, filled with rage.
Once again, the saddened princess asked the bird,
'Tell me, golden bird, how can I make my people's dreams so sweet again
till the break of dawn?'
'Black hair in rose water,' the bird chirped in reply.
'But where should I find a rose?'
'Black hair in rose water,' the bird chirped and flew away.
The princess didn't know what to do. So great was her anguish that her
eyes filled with tears, one of them falling to the ground below.
At that very moment, a young and handsome prince, who had stopped under
the balcony of the princess, took out a little box and a single red hair
from within it.
He bent down and placed the hair atop the princess's tear.
And then, a miracle happened.
Suddenly, the red hair turned into a red rose.
The prince picked the rose and took it up to the princess.
Upon seeing the rose, she immediately brushed off her tears and plucked
its petals to add to the water in the basin. Then, she dipped in her
hair, and the curse was broken.
Everyone gasped in astonishment, and the King asked the prince,
'Young man, where did you find that red hair?'
'When the princess and I were both children, I picked a single strand of
hair from her head as a sign of my loyalty to her. And she did the same
to me, pulling out a strand of my own hair.'
'It's true, father,' the princess confirmed and took out a little box.
She opened it to reveal a single hair from the prince's head inside.
Everyone was delighted with this news. The prince and Princess Rose got
married on that very same day.
Upon learning that her curse had been broken again, the wicked witch's
evilness swelled so much that she exploded into a thousand tiny pieces.
Eventually, rose blooms sprang up in every garden in the kingdom once
again. And so it went: each evening Princess Rose sang her loving
lullaby, so that all people fell asleep and had sweet dreams till the
break of dawn."
Little Red Cap;"Many years ago there lived a dear little girl who was loved by every one
who knew her; but her grand-mother was so very fond of her that she
never felt she could think and do enough to please this dear
grand-daughter, and she presented the little girl with a red silk cap,
which suited her so well, that she would never wear anything else, and
so was called Little Red-Cap.
One day Red-Cap's mother said to her, 'Come, Red-Cap, here is a nice
piece of meat, and a bottle of wine: take these to your grandmother; she
is weak and ailing, and they will do her good. Be there before she gets
up; go quietly and carefully.'
The grandmother lived far away in the wood, a long walk from the
village, and as Little Red-Cap came among the trees she met a Wolf; but
she did not know what a wicked animal it was, and so she was not at all
frightened. 'Good morning, Little Red-Cap,' he said.
'Thank you, Mr. Wolf,' said she.
'Where are you going so early, Little Red-Cap?'
'To my grandmother's,' she answered.
'And what are you carrying in that basket?'
'Some wine and meat,' she replied. 'We baked the meat yesterday, so that
grandmother, who is very weak, might have a nice strengthening meal.'
'And where does your grandmother live?' asked the Wolf.
'Oh, quite twenty minutes walk further in the forest. The cottage stands
under three great oak trees; and close by are some nut bushes, by which
you will at once know it.'
The Wolf was thinking to himself, 'She is a nice tender thing, and will
taste better than the old woman; I must act cleverly, that I may make a
meal of both.'
Presently he came up again to Little Red-Cap, and said, 'Just look at
the beautiful flowers which grow around you; why do you not look about
you? I believe you don't hear how sweetly the birds are singing. You
walk as if you were going to school; see how cheerful everything is
about you in the forest.'
And Little Red-Cap opened her eyes; and when she saw how the sunbeams
glanced and danced through the trees, and what bright flowers were
blooming in her path, she thought, 'If I take my grandmother a fresh
bunch of flowers, she will be very much pleased; and it is so very early
that I can, even then, get there in good time;' and running into the
forest, she looked about for flowers. But when she had once begun she
did not know how to leave off, and kept going deeper and deeper amongst
the trees looking for some still more beautiful flower. The Wolf,
however, ran straight to the house of the old grandmother, and knocked
at the door.
'Who's there?' asked the old lady.
'Only Little Red-Cap, bringing you some meat and wine; please open the
door,' answered the Wolf. 'Lift up the latch,' cried the grandmother; 'I
am much too ill to get up myself.'
So the Wolf lifted the latch, and the door flew open; and without a
word, he jumped on to the bed, and gobbled up the poor old lady. Then he
put on her clothes, and tied her night-cap over his head; got into the
bed, and drew the blankets over him. All this time Red-Cap was gathering
flowers; and when she had picked as many as she could carry, she thought
of her grandmother, and hurried to the cottage. She wondered  why the
door was and when she got into the room, she began to feel very ill, and
exclaimed, 'How sad I feel! I wish I had not come to-day.' Then she
said, 'Good morning,' but received no reply; so she went up to the bed,
and drew back the curtains, and there lay her grandmother, as she
imagined, with the cap drawn half over her eyes, and looking very fierce.
'Oh, grandmother, what great ears you have!' she said.
'All the better to hear you with,' was the reply.
'And what great eyes you have!'
'All the better to see you with.'
'And what great hands you have!'
'All the better to touch you with.'
'But, grandmother, what very great teeth you have!'
'All the better to eat you with;' and hardly were the words spoken when
the Wolf made a jump out of bed, and swallowed up poor Little Red-Cap also.
As soon as the Wolf had thus satisfied his hunger, he laid himself down
again on the bed, and went to sleep and snored very loudly. A huntsman
passing by overheard him, and said, 'How loudly that old woman snores! I
must see if anything is the matter.'
So he went into the cottage; and when he came to the bed, he saw the
Wolf sleeping in it. 'What! are you here, you old rascal? I have been
looking for you,' he shouted and taking up his gun, he shot the old
Wolf. When he cut open the wolf's tummy, Red-Cap and her grandmother
were both still alive, just covered in the slime that you find inside
the tummy of a wolf. That meant they both had to have extra-long baths
that evening."
Princess Polly by Sharon Krager;"To be a real princess, you have to believe in your heart that you are a
princess. There are princess all over the world and some of them don't
even know that they are one.  Princesses come in all shapes and sizes.
They do not always live in a castle, wear fancy clothes and wear crowns.
It is hard to recognize princesses sometimes.
I remember back when I was about five years old. My Grandpa said that I
was the most beautiful little princess that he had ever seen. Ever since
that day, I knew he was right. I knew that I had a big heart. I loved
people and animals of all kinds. I knew that to be a good one, I needed
to act like a little lady. So when I dressed up in my pretty dresses and
wore my fancy shoes, I knew that was what a princess was supposed to do.
When I wore normal clothes and shoes, I felt the same way too. It all
comes from the inside.
I tried not to play in sand or get dirt in my hair. I didn't ride my
bike too fast and tried to always be polite when talking to other
people. I always sat with my hands folded on my lap while waiting to go
somewhere.  I smiled and was kind to all animals. That was the way
princesses were supposed to be.
When I got a little older, I became a bigger princess. I hoped that I
could rule a kingdom where everyone was nice. I imagined that my palace
would be filled with flowers on the inside and on the outside. Everyone
that came to see me would be welcome and tea should always be served.
The pets that came to live with me would all have special little houses
to live in. All of my friends could be princesses too. Parties on
Saturday nights, lots of good food and happy times would happen in my
kingdom.
Well it didn't happen exactly that way, but I tried to keep the same
feeling inside as I did when I was growing up. Now that I am older, I
look back at all of the times I had the chance to just act like a little
princess. Not to say that there were other times that I had to be
reminded of it. Mom and Dad were always around to keep me on track.
I think it is so wonderful to be a princess or at least to try to act
like one. Not only for yourself but for every one that is around you.
The world would be a better place if there were more princesses in it.
When I was very young and playing princess outside I remember hearing my
Mother calling me in. I would say to myself,  'I will be a princess
again tomorrow. Then I will live in a faraway land. Maybe one that no
one has discovered yet.'
As I walked back to my house I sang this cute little song:
*Princess Polly I will always be*
*Come and be a princess with me*
*Good things will happen as you can see*
*Being a princess makes your heart full of glee.*"
Frog and beautiful Fairy;"Once upon a time, across seven seas, in a majestic fairy-land, there was
a beautiful castle beside the river of sweet water. And this charming
castle was the home for three fairy sisters, whose names were Shine,
Bright, and Grace. Shine was the eldest, and Grace was the youngest.
Every morning, when the sun was just rising up, Shine and Bright left
the castle and flew away for giving their blessings to the children who
were in the grave need. The youngest Grace remained in the castle. And
the reason for that was her broken wings. She was born that way. In
spite of the treatment of panacea of the fairy land, her broken wings
couldn't be healed. She would sit at the window and look at the river.
The window of castle had a clear view of the river of which flowing
water made a beautiful music, and little Grace would be lost in the
music thinking about her sisters
It was just like any other day. Her sisters were out and she was sitting
at the window gazing at flowing water of the river. In the morning, she
had a row with her sisters. She wanted to go with them. But, like any
other day, they refused on account of her damaged wings. Little Grace
was feeling low sitting on her chair, looking at the river. Her heart
was heavy.
Bored of sitting idly, she left the castle to reach the river.
It was awesome weather outside. Cool breeze was carrying the fragrance
of flowers. Peacocks were dancing, nightingales were singing sweet
melodious songs, and little bucks were running here and there merrily.
She felt really good. She sat on a big rock beside the river and
engrossed in watching golden fishes in the flow of clear water.
Suddenly, she saw a frog among fishes. As she looked at him closely, she
found that he was struggling to swim. She approached the bank and saw
that a tiny pebble was tied to a leg of the frog. So, the frog was not
able to swim, he was just drifting in the current.
Grace thought for some moments and then decided to go into the river
without caring her priceless shiny gown.
She held the frog gently in her palms and put it on the soft grass near
the bank.
'Who tied your leg, my little friend?' she asked, removing the pebble
from his leg.
'When I went to the village, a naughty kid tied that pebble on my leg,'
the frog said.
'But why did you leave the bank of the river?'
'I was alone lonely and had nothing to do. So, I went there hearing the
sound of children.'
'Don't you have a family?'  she asked as she became curious.
'No, I'm alone.' said the frog sadly.
'It's ok. Now, I'm your friend.'
Grace and that frog became friend and chatted for some time. Then, the
frog knew she couldn't fly as her wings were broken.
'Wait for me, I will be back,' the frog said.
'But where are you going?' Grace inquired.
'We are friends, I have to show you my beautiful castle.'
'Just wait for me. It won't be long.' And the frog smiled. But Grace did
not understand anything.
'Ok, I will wait.'
The frog jumped into the river and swam swiftly. He was moving faster in
the water. Soon, he was out of her sight.
Grace was all alone again. She looked at the swimming golden fishes
again. But soon, her eyes averted. She was now thinking about her
friend, the frog. She realized that she had not asked his name.
The sun was setting in the sky. It was the time when her sister would
return the castle. But she made a promise to wait. So, she waited. She
waited for about half an hour.
Just then, she spotted the frog in the river. He was swimming at
lightning fast speed. She took a sigh of relief.
'Apply it on your wings when the has sun set completely,' the frog said,
handing over a tiny herb.
'Will it cure my wings?' asked Grace in amazement.
'Yes, it will. It is panacea from my kingdom. It cures all diseases.'
'Your kingdom?' Grace was puzzled.
'Leave it. Apply the medicine; the sun is not in the sky.' The frog
chucked at the question.
Grace rubbed the herb in her palms and applied the juice of the herb to
her wings. As she did so, she felt a strange tremor in her wings and
then in her body. The next moment the biggest magic happened. Her wings,
which couldn't be treated by the panacea of the fairy land, became
perfectly alright. And she felt a strong urge to fly.
She was so happy that she didn't know what to say to her friend. And the
frog was smiling, looking at her face.
''Fly, fly you beautiful fairy, I want to see you flying,' the frog said.
And Grace flew and circled her castle many times in awe. She was on the
cloud nine. Her joy knew no limit.
She returned to the river to thank her new benevolent friend. But she
was surprised not to find the frog.
There was a beautiful prince sitting on the very rock she sat before. He
was wearing shiny gown. He was so handsome that her eyes were glued to
his face.
'Excuse me, have you seen a little frog?' she asked sheepishly,
'Oh, the frog, I was that frog,' he smiled.
He told her the whole story that once he was a prince and was under a
spell by a magician whom he used to give a lot of trouble. Once he put a
frog in his cloak. So, the magician cast a spell on him and said that he
would remain under the spell until he helped somebody. And the cure of
your wings broke the spell.
Little Grace took the prince to the castle. By then, her sisters were
back. She told everything to her sisters, and introduced the prince to
them. And the prince told them stories of his kingdom that was far away
from the fairy-land.
The castle used to be a lonely place for her when her sisters went in
the morning. But now, it was full of joy and merriment. They sang,
danced, and told beautiful stories each other.
After some days, the prince married with Grace and lived in the castle
happily ever after."
The Four Clever Sheep;"Farmer Mick and his dog Tiger lived on a sheep farm. One morning they
set off in the truck to buy some sheep. When they arrived at the market
they bought four sheep called Magic, Big Rogue, Slick and Pixie. Tiger
helped load them onto the truck and soon they were on the way back to
the farm.
Farmer Mick did not know that his new sheep were very clever. They liked
Weeping Grass because it was very sweet to eat. They liked Windmill
Grass because it grew tall and they could lie down and hide, and they
liked Silky Blue Grass because it had lots of ripe seed heads.
One day when Farmer Mick was in town, Magic made his way to the top of
the hill. When Big Rogue, Slick and Pixie caught up, Magic called them
to a meeting.
'Right,' said Magic. 'I like this farm. Farmer Mick owns the best farm
ever and we must be very clever to get to all that beautiful grass.
Because our coats are the same colour as the grass, when we get there we
can disappear very easily.'
'Look,' said Big Rogue, 'I can see plenty of Weeping Grass over there.'
'Yes, and I can see a big field of Windmill Grass further on,' said Big
Rogue.
'All that Silky Blue Grass makes me feel hungry,' said Slick.
Pixie pushed her way to the front and gave a little jump so she could
see better.
'Let me see, let me see,' she said. But by then the others were walking
back down the hill to the farm and she had to run after them.
When Farmer Mick returned, they were all standing quietly next to the
farmhouse gate.
The very next day Magic put their plan into action. As soon as the coast
was clear Big Rogue pushed against the fence until he had made a gap.
Slick and Pixie came to help and soon they could all squeeze through
into the next field where the tall Weeping Grass was growing. They ate
and ate until they were all very full. Because the grass was so high
they disappeared from view.
Farmer Mick and Tiger looked everywhere but couldn't find the clever
sheep so they decided to look for them in the morning.
Pixie was lying in the middle of the field and Magic, Big Rogue and
Slick were a little further away. Their tummies were full and it was
such a warm day that they all fell sound asleep. When they woke up the
stars were out.
Very, very early the next day, Magic and the mob pushed at the fence
until they could squeeze through into the field with the Windmill Grass.
What a feast they had. The seed heads were full and the tips of the
leaves were small crunchy and sweet, just what they liked best.
Big Rogue wanted to get to the Silky Blue Grass paddock because it was
very tall and they could hide more easily. Magic agreed, so very quietly
and on tiptoe, they pushed their way into the Silky Blue Grass and
disappeared out of sight. All that day they ate and ate, choosing the
best bits.
'Well, I'll be blowed,' Mick said to Tiger, 'where are they? Did I buy
invisible sheep?'
The fact that Farmer Mick thought they were all invisible made Pixie
giggle and soon they were all trying not to laugh out loud. Magic was
trying to keep them quiet. But it was too late, Tiger heard them and the
game was up.
'Well, well, well,' said Mick, 'my four white sheep are not invisible,
they are just very clever. They are also very greedy and have grown
quite fat on all the grass they have eaten. So off they go to the sheep
sales.'
The next day as the four clever sheep were being taken to the sale yards
Magic began to tell them about his next plan.
'No, no, no,' said Pixie,' no more of your plans Magic, from now on I
will be the leader because I am the smallest.'
'No, no, no' said Slick, 'I will be leader because I am the strongest.
'You are both wrong, it will be my turn because I'm the biggest,' said
Big Rogue.
No one knows where they are now but you can be sure they will all still
be arguing."
The Fairy;Once upon a time there was a widow who had two daughters. The elder was so much like her, both in looks and character, that whoever saw the daughter saw the mother. They were both so disagreeable and so proud that there was no living with them. The younger, who was the very picture of her father for sweetness of temper and virtue, was withal one of the most beautiful girls ever seen. As people naturally love their own likeness, this mother doted on her elder daughter, and at the same time had a great aversion for the younger. She made her eat in the kitchen and work continually. Among other things, this unfortunate child had to go twice a day to draw water more than a mile and a half from the house, and bring home a pitcherful of it. One day, as she was at this fountain, there came to her a poor woman, who begged of her to let her drink. Oh, yes, with all my heart, Goody,  said this pretty little girl. Rinsing the pitcher at once, she took some of the clearest water from the fountain, and gave it to her, holding up the pitcher all the while, that she might drink the easier. The good woman having drunk, said to her:-- You are so pretty, so good and courteous, that I cannot help giving you a gift.  For this was a fairy, who had taken the form of a poor country-woman, to see how far the civility and good manners of this pretty girl would go.  I will give you for gift,  continued the Fairy,  that, at every word you speak, there shall come out of your mouth either a flower or a jewel.  When this pretty girl returned, her mother scolded at her for staying so long at the fountain. I beg your pardon, mamma,  said the poor girl,  for not making more haste.  And in speaking these words there came out of her mouth two roses, two pearls, and two large diamonds. What is it I see there?  said her mother, quite astonished.  I think pearls and diamonds come out of the girl mouth! How happens this, my child? This was the first time she had ever called her  my child.  The girl told her frankly all the matter, not without dropping out great numbers of diamonds. Truly,  cried the mother,  I must send my own dear child thither. Fanny, look at what comes out of your sister s mouth when she speaks. Would you not be glad, my dear, to have the same gift? You have only to go and draw water out of the fountain, and when a poor woman asks you to let her drink, to give it to her very civilly. I should like to see myself going to the fountain to draw water,  said this ill-bred minx. I insist you shall go,  said the mother,  and that instantly.  She went, but grumbled all the way, taking with her the best silver tankard in the house. She no sooner reached the fountain than she saw coming out of the wood, a magnificently dressed lady, who came up to her, and asked to drink. This was the same fairy who had appeared to her sister, but she had now taken the air and dress of a princess, to see how far this girl s rudeness would go. Am I come hither,  said the proud, ill-bred girl,  to serve you with water, pray? I suppose this silver tankard was brought purely for your ladyship, was it? However, you may drink out of it, if you have a fancy.  You are scarcely polite,  answered the fairy, without anger.  Well, then, since you are so disobliging, I give you for gift that at every word you speak there shall come out of your mouth a snake or a toad.  So soon as her mother saw her coming, she cried out:-- Well, daughter?  Well, mother?  answered the unhappy girl, throwing out of her mouth a viper and a toad. Oh, mercy!  cried the mother,  what is it I see? It is her sister who has caused all this, but she shall pay for it, and immediately she ran to beat her. The poor child fled away from her, and went to hide herself in the forest nearby. The King s son, who was returning from the chase, met her, and seeing her so beautiful, asked her what she did there alone and why she cried. Alas! sir, my mother has turned me out of doors.  The King s son, who saw five or six pearls and as many diamonds come out of her mouth, desired her to tell him how that happened. She told him the whole story. The King s son fell in love with her, and, considering that such a gift was worth more than any marriage portion another bride could bring, conducted her to the palace of the King, his father, and there married her. As for her sister, she made herself so much hated that her own mother turned her out of doors. The miserable girl, after wandering about and finding no one to take her in, went to a corner of the wood, and there died.
The Princess and the Pea;"There was once a prince who wanted to marry a princess. But she must be a real princess, mind you. So he traveled all round the world, seeking such a one, but everywhere something was in the way. Not that there was any lack of princesses, but he could not seem to make out whether they were real princesses; there was always something not quite satisfactory. Therefore, home he came again, quite out of spirits, for he wished so much to marry a real princess. One evening a terrible storm came on. It thundered and lightened, and the rain poured down; indeed, it was quite fearful. In the midst of it there came a knock at the town gate, and the old king went out to open it. It was a princess who stood outside. But O dear, what a state she was in from the rain and bad weather! The water dropped from her hair and clothes, it ran in at the tips of her shoes and out at the heels; yet she insisted she was a real princess. Very well,  thought the old queen;  that we shall presently see.  She said nothing but went into the bedchamber and took off all the bedding, then laid a pea on the sacking of the bedstead. Having done this, she took twenty mattresses and laid them upon the pea and placed twenty eider-down beds on top of the mattresses. The princess lay upon this bed all the night. In the morning she was asked how she had slept. Oh, most miserably!  she said.  I scarcely closed my eyes the whole night through. I cannot think what there could have been in the bed. I lay upon something so hard that I am quite black and blue all over. It is dreadful!  It was now quite evident that she was a real princess, since through twenty mattresses and twenty eider-down beds she had felt the pea. None but a real princess could have such delicate feeling. So the prince took her for his wife, for he knew that in her he had found a true princess. And the pea was preserved in the cabinet of curiosities, where it is still to be seen unless some one has stolen it. And this, mind you, is a real story."
Cinderella;"Cinderella's mother died while she was a very little child, leaving her
to the care of her father and her step-sisters, who were very much older
than herself; for Cinderella's father had been twice married, and her
mother was his second wife. Now, Cinderella's sisters did not love her,
and were very unkind to her. As she grew older they made her work as a
servant, and even sift the cinders; on which account they used to call
her in mockery 'Cinderella.' It was not her real name, but she became
afterwards so well known by it that her proper one has been forgotten.
She was a very sweet-tempered, good girl, however, and everybody (except
her cruel sisters) loved her.
CINDERELLA AT HOME.
It happened, when Cinderella was about seventeen years old, that the
King of that country gave a ball, to which all ladies of the land, and
among the rest the young girl's sisters, were invited. And they made her
dress them for the ball, but never thought of allowing her to go there.
CINDERELLA DRESSING HER SISTERS FOR THE BALL.
'I wish you would take me to the ball with you,' said Cinderella, meekly.
'Take you, indeed!' answered the elder sister, with a sneer; 'it is no
place for a cinder-sifter: stay at home and do your work.'
When they were gone, Cinderella, whose heart was very sad, sat down and
cried bitterly; but as she sat sorrowful, thinking of the unkindness of
her sisters, a voice called to her from the garden, and she went out to
see who was there. It was her godmother, a good old Fairy.
'Do not cry, Cinderella,' she said; 'you also shall go to the ball,
because you are a kind, good girl. Bring me a large pumpkin.'
Cinderella obeyed, and the Fairy, touching it with her wand, turned it
into a grand coach. Then she desired Cinderella to go to the trap, and
bring her a rat. The girl obeyed, and a touch of the Fairy's wand turned
him into a very smart coachman. Two mice were turned into footmen; four
grasshoppers into white horses. Next, the Fairy touched Cinderella's
rags, and they became rich satin robes, trimmed with point lace.
Diamonds shone in her hair and on her neck and arms, and her kind
godmother thought she had seldom seen so lovely a girl. Her old shoes
became a charming pair of glass slippers, which shone like diamonds.
'Now go to the ball, my love,' she said, 'and enjoy yourself. But
remember, you must leave the room before the clock strikes /eleven/. If
you do not your dress will return to its original rags. I approve of
pleasure, but not of dissipation, and I expect that you will show your
gratitude by obeying me.'
Cinderella kissed and thanked her godmother. Then she stepped into her
coach and drove off, with her footmen behind, in great style. The Fairy,
when she was gone, returned to Fairyland.
Cinderella was received at the King's palace with great respect. The
Lord Chamberlain bowed low to her, thinking she must be a very great
lady by her dress and carriage, and he showed her at once into the
ball-room.
THE FAIRY GODMOTHER.
She was so beautiful that everybody looked at her, and wondered who she
was; and the Prince asked her to dance with him, and afterwards would
dance with no one else.
ARRIVAL AT THE PALACE.
But she made haste to leave a little before the hour fixed, and had time
to undress before her sisters came home. They told her a beautiful
Princess had been at the ball, with whom the Prince was delighted. They
did not know it was Cinderella herself, and she was amused to hear them
admire her grace and beauty, and say that they were sure she was a royal
lady.
The Prince was quite vexed when supper-time came, and he could not find
his beautiful partner, and no one had seen her leave the room. But in
hopes of beholding her again, he persuaded the King to give another
grand ball. As soon as her sisters were gone to it, Cinderella's
godmother arrived.
'You were so good and obedient last time, that I shall let you go out
again,' said she to the young girl.
And once more the rat, mice, grasshoppers, and pumpkin (which had gone
back to their original shapes after the first ball) were turned into the
grand carriage and attendants, and Cinderella, in rose-coloured satin
and rubies, went to the royal ball.
Directly the Prince saw her, he asked her to dance, and would have no
other partner, and as he led her past her two unkind sisters, she saw
them look at her dress with envious eyes, and knew that they wished they
were as beautiful, and as well-dressed as she was.
But in the midst of her enjoyment, Cinderella remembered the Fairy's
command, and at half-past ten glided out of the room, and drove home
again. Her sisters found her waiting to undress them in her usual rags,
and kept her up to tell her how beautiful the unknown Princess was, and
how well she was dressed.
Again the Prince was vexed at the sudden disappearance of the beautiful
stranger, and once more he persuaded the King to give a grand State ball.
'I wonder if Princess Beauty will be there!' said the sisters to
Cinderella. 'We must have new dresses, for she is so splendid. She makes
every one look shabby.'
CINDERELLA DANCES WITH THE PRINCE.
Cinderella smiled as she helped them to dress. She was sure the Fairy
would let her go to the ball too. And she was right. Her godmother,
pleased with her obedience, came in good time, and Cinderella, dressed
in blue satin and pearls, went in the same style as before.
CINDERELLA RUNS HOME AND LOSES HER SLIPPER.
The Prince would scarcely let her out of his sight, and Cinderella, who
was getting a little spoiled by all the flattery she heard, began to
think more of herself and less of the Fairy; so the time stole on, till
glancing up at the clock, she saw it wanted only five minutes to eleven.
At once she darted out of the room, and ran through the palace as fast
as she could go, but as she reached the hall, she lost one of her
precious glass slippers! She did not stop to pick it up, but rushed to
the door. Alas! the clock had struck
Eleven. She found no coach, only a pumpkin, and the rat and mice ran
quickly away when they saw her; while all her fine dress turned to rags,
and she had to run home alone in the darkness of the night.
The Prince was very much surprised when he missed Cinderella again, and
leaving the ball, went in search of her. He asked all the attendants,
but no one had seen her, and when enquiry was made of the porter, he
said that no one had gone out of the palace except a poor ragged
beggar-girl.
However, the Prince's search was rewarded by his finding the glass
slipper, which he well knew belonged to the unknown Princess. He loved
Cinderella so much that he now resolved to marry her; and as he felt
sure that no one else could wear such a tiny shoe as hers was, he sent
out a herald to proclaim that whichever lady in his kingdom could put on
this glass slipper should be his wife.
All the great ladies who wished to be a Princess tried to put it on, but
in vain. Cinderella's sisters tried, but could not get it on, and then
Cinderella asked if she might try. They laughed at her; but the Prince,
hearing of her wish, sent for her. She went with her sisters in her poor
dress, but very clean, and at once put on the slipper. Then she drew the
fellow of it from her pocket, and slipped it on her other foot.
The Prince, who had thought the moment he saw her that the poor girl was
very much like the beautiful Princess, was delighted. He insisted on
Cinderella telling him her story, which she did very modestly, and all
listened with wonder.
CINDERELLA TRIES ON THE SLIPPER.
As her tale ended, the Fairy godmother suddenly entered the room, and
placing her godchild's hand in the Prince's, said:
'Take this young girl for your wife, Prince; she is good and patient,
and as she has known how to submit to injustice meekly, she will know
how to reign justly.'
CINDERELLA MARRIED TO THE PRINCE.
So Cinderella was married to the Prince in great state, and they lived
together very happily. She forgave her sisters, and treated them always
very kindly, and the Prince had great cause to be glad that he had found
the glass slipper."
Сircus girl;"My mum can fit inside a jar. SHEILA SPANGLE THE AMAZING CONTORTIONIST
reads the sign on our caravan.
Papa’s Herman the Mighty Magician. And my older brother Anthony is a
trapeze artist.
I’m Cassie, the Family Disappointment. Can’t fold my body into a tiny
ball. Can’t produce coins from behind people’s ears. And unlike Anthony,
I’m terrified of heights.
My only skill is I play the violin.
'Like an angel,' says Madam Zizinski, my music teacher.
'Like a squawking bird,' says Anthony.
'You’re a circus girl, Cassie,' Mama says. 'Circus girls don’t play the
violin.'
'You’ve a rare gift,' says Madam Zizinkski.
I believe her. Between acts, she tells fortunes with her crystal ball.
After Tuesday night’s show I’m practising my music when the circus owner
stands outside our van talking to Papa.
Usually Mr Sharman speaks with a cheerful voice. Tonight he sounds
serious.  'Profits are down,’ he says. ‘I’m going to have to let some of
our people go.’
I wonder if Mr Sharman is going to sack our whole family. Then where
would we go? The circus is our life.
Next day I find Madam in her van packing a suitcase.
'Where are you going?' I ask.
Madam reaches out and draws me to her.  'Oh little one,' she says in her
heavy accent. 'I will miss you so much. Mr Sharman has given me my
marching orders.'
'You’re marching? Are you in a new act?'
Madam smiles. 'No, ma petite. I am leaving the circus.'
It’s too much! I burst into tears.
Madam croons soft and low in my ear as she rocks me.
'I want to go with you,' I blubber.
'I’m going to visit my family in Europe,' Madam says. 'It is a good thing.'
'Not for me.'
Madam sighs. 'You will be sad for a while. But, dearest Cassie, it will
not last.'
'Yes it will. You’re my best friend.'
Madam Zizinski slips me off her lap. 'Look, little one. Look into the ball.'
When Madam peers into her crystal ball, she can see into the future.
'Ah!' she says. 'Here you are. I see many happy people around you.'
I peer into the ball.  'Where am I?'
'In a good place,' says Madam. 'The angel has played her music. And
soothed the savage beast.'
Next day I want to be happy. But I feel lost when Madam leaves.
Mama gives me Calipso, our youngest chimp. 'Look after her; like you
would a baby.'
Mr Sharman sold Calipso’s mother to a zoo. I hug my new pet and mutter
angry words about Mr Sharman.
Calipso pokes her fingers into my mouth. And up her nose. Even though he
makes me laugh, I’m still sad. I’m even sadder when Mr Sharman sacks
Shortie, the lion tamer.
'Herman,' the boss tells Papa, 'I want Cassie and Calipso to be part of
your new act.'
Papa has to teach Calipso tricks. I have to play the violin.
I’m scared. I don’t want to perform.  My music isn’t good enough.
That night, all night, our circus elephant Ellie trumpets. Nobody can
sleep.          'Shut that jumbo up,' Mr Sharman tells Papa.
Papa talks softly to Ellie. But still she trumpets.
'Go play her some music, Cassie,' says Mama.
I grumble as it’s cold outdoors, but do as I’m told. I play a polka and
then a waltz. Soon Ellie has calmed.
'Look,' says Papa, 'She’s dancing!'
It’s true. Ellie’s swaying in time with my music.
For the first time ever I don’t feel like the Family Disappointment.
Mama fits Papa and me with colourful clown outfits. I have a red,
plastic nose and a purple wig.
Calipso claps his hands and somersaults when he sees me. He curls back
his lips and bobs his head up and down.
'Don’t laugh at me, you naughty boy!' I say.
I’m so scared about performing. Mama hugs me. 'Do your best,' she whispers.
In the Big Top the show goes on. Mama squashes herself in her jar. Then
Anthony, so strong and handsome, flies on the trapeze.
I’m on next.
'Presenting Cassie, Calipso and Charlie, the Incredible Clowns!'
announces Mr Sharman.
The three of us hurtle into the ring. Papa and Calipso tumble while I
play a cheerful tune. Then they chase one another while I play as fast
as I can.
When I stop, Papa bellows, 'What’s this?' He pulls a bunch of flowers
out of a boy’s ear.
It’s a trick, of course. But the kid is amazed.
Calipso grabs Papa’s flowers and races off. Papa chases him. I play
again. My music is sweet and the people are swaying in time with it.
People love Calipso’s antics. And Papa’s magic. If only Madam Zizinski
was here to hear me play. She’d enjoy our act so much!
While we entertain, workers build a cage in the ring for the big cats.
When it’s finished, Papa, Calipso and I bow and leave.
'You were wonderful, Cassie,' says Mama, waiting in the wings.
Papa and I stay to watch the big cats. All day they’ve been roaring,
pacing up and down.
'They miss Shorty,' says Papa. 'I don’t like the look of them.'
Down the chute the four of them go. Snarling and showing their razor-
sharp teeth.
Sheila the tigress looks extra mean. She snaps at Mr Sharman. He bellows
at her. Flicks his whip on her rump.
Now the lions are perched on their stands. When Mr Sharman tries to get
Big Boy to jump through a hoop, he refuses.
'He’d do it easy for Shorty,' I whisper.
The audience starts a slow hand clap. Mr Sharman yells at Big Boy and
whips him, hard.
In a flash Sheila leaps from her stand. She crashes into Mr Sharman and
knocks him down.
'Oh no!' the audience cries.
Papa charges into the cage.
'Don’t go, Papa!' I scream.
Now Anthony is going in, too!
Papa grabs Mr Sharman’s whip and flicks it at Sheila and Big Boy. Mr
Sharman is lying still on the ground. People are screaming. Calipso has
his hands over his eyes and is whimpering.
Sheila bares her teeth. Marcelle paces back and forth, roaring.  So do
Big Boy and Roman. They’ve never been so angry. So fierce. So scary.
I wish there was something I could do.
Then I remember: 'You will sooth the savage beast,' Madam Zizinski said.
I tuck my violin under my chin, raise my bow, and play the sweetest
music I know.
Anthony pulls Mr Sharman to the cage door.
Papa is trying to herd the cats into the chute but they won’t go. They
don’t seem to hear my music. For sure Sheila is going to leap onto Papa.
Tear him to pieces.
Not one of the cats is doing what Papa tells them. Shorty would have
sorted them out in a flash. But Papa has never worked the cats before.
They’re fierce and so, so mean.
I close my eyes and focus on my music. But the cats don’t seem to hear it.
All alone, Papa is struggling for control. The cats bellow at him,
refusing to do as he says.
Now, remembering how my music calmed Ellie, I start up a waltz. /Da Da
Da, Da Du Da Da!/
Now Sheila comes to the side of the cage, roaring. I would like to yell
at her to behave herself. But I need to concentrate on my tune.
One of Sheila’s ears is raised. She looks straight at me. She hears my
music!  Marcelle, Big Boy and Roman are quiet now, too. The people are
hushed. Papa’s whiplash sizzles in the air.
I keep playing my waltz. /Da Da Da, Da Du Da Da!/  The audience begins
clapping in time. The spotlight swings onto me.
Sheila’s tail slaps against the cage bars. It’s as though she’s
clapping, too. When she growls, it’s a good growl, a way of saying
something nice. I smile at her.
Marcelle now plods towards the chute. Big Boy follows her. And Roman,
too. Before they pass the door, each of them turns and growls, as though
saying 'Thank you, Cassie.’
I want to cry and to thank /them/ for being good.
Now only Sheila is left in the ring.
'Come on, girl!' Papa shouts.
As meekly as a kitten, Sheila pads over to the chute, turns, and growls
kindly at me.
When her tail disappears, I stop playing and stretch my aching fingers.
I’ve never played so long before. Nor as good.
Papa closes the chute door, smiles at me and bows to the audience.
People start clapping and foot-stamping and calling, 'Circus girl!
Circus girl!'
They’re cheering me! Me, Cassie Spangle.
Papa grins. Mama sweeps me into her arms and hugs me. 'Well done,
Cassie, well done!'
'I’m proud of you,' Anthony says.
Calipso claps.
'Bow,' whispers Papa.
I bow.
Madam Zizinski would be so proud."
The Husband who was to Mind the House;"Once upon on a time there was a man so grumpy and cross he never thought
his wife did anything right in the house. So one evening, in haymaking
time, he came home, scolding and swearing, and showing his teeth and
making a dust.
'Dear love, don’t be so angry; there’s a good man,' said his good wife;
'tomorrow let’s change our work. I’ll go out with the mowers and mow,
and you shall mind the house at home.'
Yes, the husband thought that would do very well. He was quite willing,
he said.
So, early next morning, his wife took a scythe over her neck, and went
out into the hayfield with the mowers and began to mow; but the man was
to mind the house, and do the work at home.
First of all he wanted to churn the butter; but when he had churned a
while he got thirsty, and went down to the cellar to tap a barrel of
ale. So, just when he had knocked in the bung, and was putting the tap
into the cask, he heard overhead the pig come into the kitchen. Then off
he ran up the cellar steps, with the tap in his hand, as fast as he
could, to look after the pig, lest it should upset the churn; but when
he got up, and saw the pig had already knocked the churn over, and stood
there, routing and grunting amongst the cream which was running all over
the floor, he got so wild with rage that he quite forgot the ale-barrel,
and ran at the pig as hard as he could. He caught it, too, just as it
ran out of doors, and gave it such a kick that piggy lay for dead on the
spot. Then all at once he remembered he had the tap in his hand; but
when he got down to the cellar, every drop of ale had run out of the cask.
Then he went into the dairy and found enough cream left to fill the
churn again, and so he began to churn, for butter they must have at
dinner. When he had churned a bit, he remembered that their milking cow
was still shut up in the stable, and hadn’t had a bit to eat or a drop
to drink all the morning, though the sun was high. Then all at once he
thought ’twas too far to take her down to the meadow, so he’d just get
her up on the roof — for the house, you must know, was thatched with
sods, and a fine crop of grass was growing there. Now their house lay
close up against a steep bank, and he thought if he laid a plank across
to the thatch at the back he’d easily get the cow up.
But still he couldn’t leave the churn, for there was his little babe
crawling about on the floor, and 'if I leave it,' he thought, 'the child
is sure to upset it.' So he took the churn on his back, and went out
with it; but then he thought he’d better first water the cow before he
turned her out on the thatch; so he took up a bucket to draw water out
of the well; but, as he stooped down at the well’s brink, all the cream
ran out of the churn over his shoulders, and so down into the well.
Now it was near dinner-time, and he hadn’t even got the butter yet; so
he thought he’d best boil the porridge, and filled the pot with water,
and hung it over the fire. When he had done that, he thought the cow
might perhaps fall off the thatch and break her legs or her neck. So he
got up on the house to tie her up. One end of the rope he made fast to
the cow’s neck, and the other he slipped down the chimney and tied round
his own thigh; and he had to make haste, for the water now began to boil
in the pot, and he had still to grind the oatmeal.
So he began to grind away; but while he was hard at it, down fell the
cow off the housetop after all, and as she fell she dragged the man up
the chimney, by the rope. There he stuck fast; and as for the cow, she
hung half-way down the wall, swinging between heaven and earth, for she
could neither get down nor up.
And now the wife had waited seven lengths and seven breadths for her
husband to come and call them home to dinner; but never a call they had.
At last she thought she’d waited long enough, and went home. But when
she got there and saw the cow hanging in such an ugly place, she ran up
and cut the rope in two with her scythe. But as she did this, down came
her husband out of the chimney; and so when his old lady came inside the
kitchen, there she found him standing on his head in the porridge-pot."
